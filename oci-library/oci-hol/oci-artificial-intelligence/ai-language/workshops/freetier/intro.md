# OCI Language

## Introduction

OCI Language empowers developers with production ready pre-trained models to automate sophisticated text analysis at scale without requiring any machine learning expertise. It can be accessed through REST APIs and SDKs.

The Language service contains these pretrained language processing capabilities:

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Identifies sentiment at the document, sentence and aspect level.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition
Identifies common entities, people, places, locations, email, and so on.

### 3. Key Phrase Extraction
Identify the most salient talking points in your text.

### 4. Language Detection
Detects languages based on the given text, and includes a confidence score.

### 5. Text Classification
Identifies the document category and subcategory that the text belongs to.

Explore the Language service within the Oracle Cloud AI service group to perform NLP tasks like detecting languages, extracting key elements, classifying intent, detecting the sentiment, etc., in the text with a few simple steps.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 1 hour

### Objectives:

* Understand a high level overview of the OCI Language
* Understand the full cycle/workflow of services provided in the OCI Language
* Learn to use REST API to interact with OCI Language
* Learn to use CLI to interact with OCI Language
* Learn to use the OCI Language SDKs.
* Learn to access OCI Language in DataScience NotebookSession
<!-- * Learn to access OCI Language Service in Data Flow. -->

### Prerequisites:
