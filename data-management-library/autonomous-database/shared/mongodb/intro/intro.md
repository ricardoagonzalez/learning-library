# Introduction #

## Introduction to Oracle Autonomous JSON Database
Autonomous JSON Database is designed for JSON-centric development at low cost. Developers can use both the API for MongoDB and Oracle SQL for accessing the same document data, avoiding the need to move data to a separate database for analytics, machine learning, spatial analysis, and more. This provides an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, with advanced features such as:

- Full **analytical queries** and reports using scalable SQL
- **Joins** between different JSON document collections, or between JSON documents and other relational data
- Expose relational data and analytical query **results as MongoDB collections**
- Run **machine learning** algorithms or **spatial analysis** over JSON document data
- Low Code application development using **Oracle APEX**
- ACID **transactions** without limits on duration or data sizes
- Enterprise **security** features, such as Database Vault to prevent administrators from accessing user data.

The API for MongoDB is also available for Oracleâ€™s flagship cloud database service, Autonomous Database.
