## About this Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the suite of data tools built into the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse. The workshop is designed to be used alongside your own cloud account (paid or Bring-Your-Own-License) or you can register and claim free trial credits which provides up to 3,300 hours of cloud time, and 2 TB of storage, which is more than enough time and storage space to run this workshop. 

Estimated Workshop Duration: 1 hour, 40 minutes

### Welcome to Oracle MovieStream

Oracle MovieStream is a fictitious online movie streaming company. Customers log into Oracle MovieStream using their computers, tablets, and phones where they are presented with a targeted list of movies based on their past viewing behavior. The company is now looking for better, smarter ways to track performance, identifying target customers with campaigns to promote new services, new movies, and new viewing platforms.

Many of the scenarios in the rest of this workshop will very likely match the challenges you are seeing in your business and we hope the following examples will give you some insights into how Oracle can help you solve these common everyday challenges.
