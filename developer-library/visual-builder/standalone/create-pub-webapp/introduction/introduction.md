You'll also create business objects to store your app's data and learn how to build pages to edit that data.

Estimated Time: 115 minutes

### What is Oracle Visual Builder?
Oracle Visual Builder provides easy access to data from any REST-based service, and lets you create reusable business objects for storing and managing data. Using cloud-based visual development tools, you can create and test responsive web and mobile apps without having to install any additional software. It provides a rich set of visual tools that enable you to quickly lay out pages in your applications by dragging and dropping UI components and customizing their attributes to define behavior.
