# How do I find my tenancy OCID?
Duration: 1 minutes

If you use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API, you need your tenancy's OCID in order to sign the API requests. You also use the tenancy ID in some of the IAM API operations.

## Where to Find Your Tenancy's OCID

Get the tenancy OCID from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console on the **Tenancy Details** page:

1. Open the **Profile** menu and click **Tenancy: <your_tenancy_name>**.
2. The tenancy OCID is shown under **Tenancy Information**. Click **Copy** to copy it to your clipboard.

The tenancy OCID looks something like this (notice the word "tenancy" in it):
```
ocid1.tenancy.oc1..<unique_ID>
```
