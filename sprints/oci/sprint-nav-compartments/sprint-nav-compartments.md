# How do I navigate compartments?
Duration: 1 minutes

Compartments are tenancy-wide, across regions. When you create a compartment, it is available in every region that your tenancy is subscribed to. You can get a cross-region view of your resources in a specific compartment with the tenancy explorer.

## Working with Compartments

To get a full list of your compartments, please do the following:

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Identity & Security**.
2. Under **Identity**, click **Compartments**. A list of the compartments you have access to is displayed.
