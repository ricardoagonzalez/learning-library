## Restart Autonomous Database

Perform the following prerequisite steps as necessary:
* Open the navigation menu. Click **Oracle Database**. Under Autonomous Database, click Autonomous Data Warehouse, Autonomous JSON Database, or Autonomous Transaction Processing depending on your workload.
* Choose your **Compartment**.
* In the list of Autonomous Databases, click the display name of the database you want to administer.

To restart your Autonomous Database:
1. On the **Details** page, from the **More Actions** drop-down list, select **Restart**.
2. In the confirmation dialog, select **Restart** to confirm.

When concurrent operations such as scaling or creating a manual backup are active, the confirmation also confirms either pausing or canceling the concurrent operation.
