# How can I use Oracle LiveLabs?

Duration: 5 minutes

Before you get started with any workshop in [Oracle LiveLabs](http://developer.oracle.com/livelabs), you will need an Oracle Cloud account either a Freetier, Always Free, customer/partner-owned or Oracle-owned cloud tenancy. Oracle LiveLabs provides the environments for most of our workshops. If you want to extend the workshop to create a proof-of-concept or start a project of their own, the workshops also run in Oracle Free Trial environments!

## Using Oracle LiveLabs

### **Choose workshop**

- From the catalog of workshops, choose the workshop you want to run by filtering the workshops based on different categories like Role, Focus, Product, etc.

- Once you have decided the workshop you want to run, click on **Launch**.

### **Define where you want to run the workshop**

- There are four different ways you can choose to run your workshop in Oracle LiveLabs.

    - **Free Trial** - Oracle Cloud Free Tier allows you to sign up for an Oracle Cloud account which provides a number of Always Free services and a Free Trial with US$300 of free credit to use on all eligible Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services for up to 30 days. You need a valid email address to [request a free trial account.](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/blob/master/common/labs/cloud-login/pre-register-free-tier-account.md)

    - **Always Free** - The Always Free services are available for an unlimited time. The Free Trial services may be used until your US$300 of free credits are consumed or the 30 days have expired, whichever comes first.

    - **Run on your Tenancy** (Paid Tenancy) - Choose this option if you have access to your customer or partner-owned tenancy and want to run the workshop in that tenancy.

    - **Reserve Workshop on LiveLabs** - We design our workshops using a flexible set of instructions for Free Trial and Always Free accounts, or you can spin up an environment on one of our tenancies as well. When trying to run on our tenancy (completely free!), you get the benefit of trying out Oracle Cloud without paying to sign up for an environment.

        - Here, you reserve the workshop environment on LiveLabs tenancy to run your workshop now or schedule to provision the environment for later as well.

        - In most workshops, when you reserve an environment, the setup is automated, which means when you Launch the workshop, are provided with pre-provisioned resources, for example, Oracle Autonomous Instance. This saves your time creating your environment and helps you focus more on Oracle Product/Technology functionality.

        - You can always extend an active reservation.

        - At the end of your LiveLabs reservation, the environment created for the workshop and all the objects created in the workshop are deleted from the tenancy. If you need to preserve objects you created, we recommend you run the workshop in another tenancy, e.g. Always Free. Your objects will persist according to the rules and policies of that tenancy.

- Depending on the type of workshop configuration and setup, a workshop can have all four options to choose or, a combination of options, or just a single option to choose.

- Define where you want to run the workshop based on the different options you have for that workshop and click on that respective button.
