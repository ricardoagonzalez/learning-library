Duration: 1 minute

## Split your screen to view Oracle Cloud and Oracle LiveLabs workshop side-by-side

If you would like to split your screen so you can view Oracle Cloud in one window and the LiveLabs workshop in the other, follow these instructions:

**For Windows:**

- Open Oracle Cloud in one browser window and the Oracle LiveLabs Workshop content in another.
- Click your cursor in the Oracle Cloud window, press the Windows key, and the left arrow key.
- Repeat the process for the Oracle LiveLabs workshop window, but press the right arrow key instead.

**For Mac:**

Note: Split view requires OS X El Capitan or later (10.11.6).

- Hover your pointer over the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of your Oracle Cloud window. Or click and hold the button.
- Choose "Tile Window to Left of Screen". The window then fills the left side of the screen.
- Repeat step 1 for the Oracle LiveLabs workshop window, but this time choose "Tile Window to Right of Screen" from the menu.
