# I donâ€™t see my reservation when I sign in to LiveLabs?

Duration: 1 minute

If a workshop environment was provisioned for you, it was assigned to the email address you provided while reserving the environment for that workshop.

The email address you provided while reserving the environment **must** match your Oracle account email with which you are logged in to access the reservation in LiveLabs.

If the email you provided while reserving the environment is not the same as the one you are signed in to the Oracle account right now, sign out of the current Oracle account and sign in again to the Oracle account with the same email address you provided while reserving the environment.
