Duration: 1 minute

## Navigate to the assigned compartment

If you are not able to view your resource like compute instance or an Autonomous Database in the compartment, then you are not in the compartment assigned to you. Change to the correct compartment.

1. Check if you are in the assigned tenancy of your LiveLabs reservation.

2.  Make sure you set your region to the one provided in the workshop details section of your reservation.

3.  Then, under **List Scope**, copy and paste the compartment name in the **Compartment** drop-down and select the correct compartment provided to you from the compartment drop-down list.
