# How can I launch an Oracle LiveLabs workshop?

Duration: 5 minutes

Before you get started with any workshop in [Oracle LiveLabs](http://developer.oracle.com/livelabs), you will need an Oracle Cloud account either a Freetier, Always Free, customer/partner-owned or Oracle-owned cloud tenancy.

There are four different ways you can choose to run your workshop in Oracle LiveLabs.

- **Free Trial** - Oracle Cloud Free Tier allows you to sign up for an Oracle Cloud account which provides a number of Always Free services and a Free Trial with US$300 of free credit to use on all eligible Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services for up to 30 days. You need a valid email address to [request a free trial account.](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/blob/master/common/labs/cloud-login/pre-register-free-tier-account.md)

- **Always Free** - The Always Free services are available for an unlimited time. The Free Trial services may be used until your US$300 of free credits are consumed or the 30 days have expired, whichever comes first.

- **Run on your Tenancy** (Paid Tenancy) - Choose this option if you have access to your customer or partner-owned tenancy and want to run the workshop in that tenancy.

- **Reserve Workshop on LiveLabs** - We design our workshops using a flexible set of instructions for Free Trial and Always Free accounts, or you can spin up an environment on one of our tenancies as well. When trying to run on our tenancy (completely free!), you get the benefit of trying out Oracle Cloud without paying to sign up for an environment.

Here we discuss the steps to launch a workshop only for the first three options (free tier/always free/paid).

## Launch free tier/always free/paid workshop

### **Choose workshop**

- From the catalog of workshops, choose the workshop you want to run by filtering the workshops based on different categories like Role, Focus, Product, etc. Check the Always Free checkbox under the Workshop Type filter if you specifically want to run in an Always Free tenancy.

- Once you have decided the workshop you want to run, click on **Launch**.

### **Define where you want to run the workshop**

- Depending on the type of workshop configuration and setup, a workshop can have all the four options to choose or, a combination of options, or just a single option to choose.

- Define where you want to run the workshop based on the different options you have for that workshop among the brown buttons (free tier/always free/paid) and click on that respective button.

### **Choose one of the brown buttons (free tier/always free/paid)**
