# What is Oracle LiveLabs?

Duration: 1 minute

Oracle LiveLabs provides you a way to interact directly with Oracle Cloud and on-premises products instantly! And LiveLabs is completely free! This platform delivers curated technical on-premises and cloud hands-on labs that can be done using either your Free tier, Always Free, customer/partner-owned, or Oracle-owned cloud tenancies.

We have over 300+ workshops on a range of products, technologies, and levels. The catalog is ever-growing, so you can come back often and see what is new. To access Oracle LiveLabs, search Oracle LiveLabs in your search engine of choice or use the link - [http://developer.oracle.com/livelabs](http://developer.oracle.com/livelabs)

The high-quality self-service workshops provide a step-by-step set of instructions that  guide you through the features and functionality of Oracle products. Each workshop is curated to ensure you have the most current and accurate experience possible.

## How LiveLabs Work?

Oracle LiveLabs allows you to try Oracle Cloud for free and learn a technical skill without creating an account or Oracle Cloud tenancy. Each LiveLabs reservation provides a self-contained environment to run the workshop. The environment is removed once the reservation time expires. Oracle LiveLabs provides the environments for most of our workshops and if you want to extend the workshop to create a proof-of-concept or start a project of their own, the workshops also run in Oracle Free Trial environments!
