# What happens to my objects when my reservation expires?

Duration: 1 minute

At the end of your LiveLabs reservation, the environment created for the workshop and all the objects created in the workshop are deleted from the tenancy. If you need to preserve objects you create, we recommend you run the workshop in another tenancy, e.g. Always Free. Your objects will persist according to the rules and policies of that tenancy.
