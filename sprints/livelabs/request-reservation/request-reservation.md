# How can I request an Oracle LiveLabs reservation?

Duration: 5 minutes

We design our workshops using a flexible set of instructions for Free Trial and Always Free accounts, or you can spin up an environment on one of our tenancies as well. When trying to run on our tenancy (completely free!), you get the benefit of trying out Oracle Cloud without paying to sign up for an environment.

When you click on **Reserve Workshop on LiveLabs** for a workshop, you reserve the workshop environment on LiveLabs tenancy to run your workshop now or schedule to provide the environment for later. In most of the workshops, when you reserve an environment, the setup is automated, which means when you Launch the workshop, you are provided with the pre-provisioned resources, for example, Oracle Autonomous Instance. This saves your time in creating your environment and helps you focus more on Oracle Product/Technology functionality. You can always extend an active reservation.

Note that at the end of your LiveLabs reservation, the environment created for the workshop and all the objects created in the workshop are deleted from the tenancy. If you need to preserve objects you created, we recommend you run the workshop in another tenancy, e.g. Always Free. Your objects will persist according to the rules and policies of that tenancy.
