# I am having connectivity issues?

Duration: 1 minute

If you are connected to a VPN, Corporate Network, or behind a strict Firewall, you may face connectivity issues. If any of these three conditions are true, some ports in your network may be closed to traffic.

## Possible scenarios and recommended solutions

**Possible issues**

1.  Uploading data through Database Actions in your web browser and applications like the Oracle Analytics Tool could be restricted and may appear to "Hang" or freeze.

2.  You can’t access GitHub or LiveLabs YouTube videos because your company blocks the site.

3. You may not able to connect via SSH to the server as described in the workshop.

**Possible solutions we recommend trying**

We recommend trying these options to resolve connectivity issues:

1.   Disconnect from your VPN or your company’s VPN and try again if applicable.

2.  If you are connected to a corporate network, try switching to a public or a "clear" network if allowed.

3.  Contact your IT Administrator to see if adding exceptions to your network or firewall would be viable.

4.  Try a different browser. We recommend using Chrome, Firefox or another computer.

5.  Check with your customer upfront if possible.
